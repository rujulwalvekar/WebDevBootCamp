    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2><emp>Brief</emp></h2>
    <p>From the age of 10 I have been playing <b>Lawn Tennis</b>, and it is not an easy game to master.
        <br>
        It's been hard to cope with studies and the very long hours of practice required for sports, I have come very close to giving up on Lawn Tennis once or twice when I enrolled in Engineering but I managed to promote Lawn Tennis in my University by taking a lead and was selected as the Captain and I have been balancing my drive to code, academics and passion of sports since then.
        I am that person, I don't throw in the towel easily, once I've set my mind to something, I achieve it.
        <br>
        <i>Now I channel that same determination as a coder, adjust with any adversities that may come my way</i>.
